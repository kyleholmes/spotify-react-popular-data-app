## How to run it
1. **Install [Node 6](https://nodejs.org)**.
2. **Clone this repository.**
3. **Make sure you're in the directory you just created.**
4. **Install the Node Packages.** - `npm install`
5. **Run the app.** - `npm start -s`
This will automatically run the build, start up a webserver, and open the application in your default browser.
